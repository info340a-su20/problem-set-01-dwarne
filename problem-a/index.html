    <p>
        Obi-Wan Kenobi comes from the <cite><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_Wars">
        Star Wars</a></cite> movies and is one of the most important characters. He was trained by
        Qui-Gon Jin and eventually became a Jedi-Master who trained the infamous Anaking Skywalker.
        Obi-Wan is always associated with his blue lightsaber, and can be thought of as one of the 
        most calm and collected Jedi to ever live. Never stumbling in the face of opposition or chaos,
        Obi-Wan embodies exactly what it means to be a Jedi, and he became a role model for many younglings
        throughout the galaxy. He also was the mentor for Luke Skywalker after Luke's father Anakin
        turned to the dark side and became Darth Vader. Together, Obi-Wan and Luke were able to restore 
        peace to the galaxy.

    <p>Here are 3 reaons why I admire Obi-Wan Kenobi:</p>
    <ul>
        <li class="important-fact">He is extremely graceful when wielding a lightsaber, and is one of the most skilled at fighting.</li>
        <li>He cares deeply about those he loves, and was a father figure to Anakin when they found young Anakin on Tatooine.</li>
        <li>He is never reckless in his decision-making, and doesn't let his emotions get in the way of making the right call.</li>
    </ul>
